## Idea
- Multiple files each contaimning some words
- Remembers problematic words and gives them more to you 
- Can generate words using vocabulary you know (would need to be hooked to some grammer as well)
- Can ignore accents and can be configured to ignore or not
- We can tell how close we got to the actual word and maybe take taht into account
